# Essential Elements
A plot is made of different components such as data, axis, title, legend... and has different elements such as colour, shape linetype... Each of these components and elements can be changed and customized. Click on the figure to get information on how to change each component.

Here I want a clickable image, where you can click on the different components of a plot. In the according chapter you can see what and how to change things.

```{r clickable plot, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/SimplePlot1.png")
```

Here is a list of things that should be explained.
