# Why is data visualization important?

On a daily bases, a scientist collects, analyses, presents and reports data.
The data is the core of a scientists work.
Visualising and reporting scientific outcomes is therefore a key element and an important skill to aquire.
A cleverly constrcted figure can summarise and condense a large amount of information and help to communicate results to the audience.
Figures often say much more than words, numbers and tables.

Figures, are an important part of scientific reports and papers, and they need to be clear, attractive and convincing (Ref Wilkes).
How to produce such figures is a skill that can be learnt.

In the data visualization part, we will present the basics of how to make figures with different types and complexity of data.
We are using the ggplot2 package (REF), because it is powerful and flexible.
Note that ggplot is not the only way to make figures in R.
We will also give tips for how to make "good" figures, tables, write figure/table caption, and present data in a report.

```{r ggplot hierarchy, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/painting.png")
```
