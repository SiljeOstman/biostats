```

One-way ANOVA is a parametric test designed to **compare the means of three or more groups**. The null hypothesis `H0` states that the means of all groups to be tested are equal. As usual, the test will return a p-value in the end, and you will be able to decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis depending on this p-value.

The function to use in R is `lm()` followed by `anova()`. This option is used to fit a linear model and will work in virtually all cases. 

Let's take an example. Here, let's say that we want to check whether the average size of blue ground beetles (*Carabus intricatus*) differs depending on their location. We consider 3 different locations, for example 3 forests beautifully named `A`, `B` and `C`. In each location, we measure the size (in millimeters) of 10 individuals.

To create the corresponding dataframe in R, use the following code:
```{r dataframe}
# response variable
size <- c(25,22,28,24,26,24,22,21,23,25,26,30,25,24,21,27,28,23,25,24,20,22,24,23,22,24,20,19,21,22)

# predictor variable
location <- as.factor(c(rep("ForestA",10), rep("ForestB",10), rep("ForestC",10)))

# dataframe
my.dataframe <- data.frame(size,location)
```
<br/><br/> 

It is always nice and useful to start with visualizing the whole dataset, so let's plot the data:
```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(my.dataframe, aes(x = location, y = size)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
<br/><br/> 

### Assumptions

The assumptions are:

+ **independence of observations** (each individual is represented by 1 entry/measurement ONLY)
+ **normality of distribution** (to be tested for each group, for example with the [Shapiro-Wilk test](https://biostats.w.uib.no/test-for-normality-shapiro-wilks-test/){target="_blank"})
+ **homogeneity of variance** (to be tested with, for example, [Levene's test](https://biostats.w.uib.no/test-for-homogeneity-of-variances-levenes-test/){target="_blank"})
+ groups contain [**no outliers**](http://biostats.w.uib.no/finding-outliers/){target="_blank"}.

<br/><br/>

### Running the test

The syntax is `lm(response ~ predictor, data = dataframe)` where `response` is the vector that contain the response variable, `predictor` is the vector that contains the predictor variable or factor (which categorizes the observations) and `dataframe` the name of the dataframe that contains the data. 
We first need to fit a linear model with `lm()` and then we store the results in the object `results.lm`. We thus display the result of the analysis using `anova()`:
```{r lm}
results.lm <- lm(size~location, data=my.dataframe)
anova(results.lm)
```
This output provides you with the F-value (7.1101) and the corresponding p-value (0.003307). The hypothesis `H0` stating that the means of the groups are equal is thus to be rejected.

<br/><br/>

**But this does not tell us anything about the groups which means are significantly different... **

Indeed, the ANOVA needs to be followed by another test if we want to check which of the groups are different from the others. For that, we will need a *post-hoc* test, and these three options will help you do that:

+ [pairwise t-test with the function pairwise.t.test()](http://biostats.w.uib.no/post-hoc-tests-pairwise-comparisons/){target="_blank"},
+ [Tukeyâs Honest Significant Difference (HSD) with TukeyHSD()](https://biostats.w.uib.no/post-hoc-tests-tukey-hsd/){target="_blank"},
+ [multiple comparisons in linear models with glht()](https://biostats.w.uib.no/post-hoc-tests-multiple-comparisons-in-linear-models/){target="_blank"}.

<br/><br/>

### Alternative

The non-parametric [Kruskal-Wallis test](http://biostats.w.uib.no/comparing-two-means-kruskal-wallis-test/){target="_blank"} is a good alternative to the one-way ANOVA when the assumption of normality of distribution is violated.
