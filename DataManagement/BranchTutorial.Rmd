## Forks
A fork is a copy of a github repository. It can be your repository or belong to somebody else. But why would you want to make a copy of a repository? Forking a repository allows you to make changes or develope new code without affecting the original repository

```{r how forks work, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("Pics/.jpg")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

### Fork repo (on github)
Got to Github, login and go to the repository you want to fork. Click on the fork button on the top right of the page. A new window will appear and you can give the forked repository a new name.

```{r fork repo, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/1. Fork_repo.png")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

### Clone (Rstudio)
On the top left you find the new name of your repository and you can see it has been forked from biostats.
Click on the green button on the top right. Copy the url link.
```{r clone, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/2. Clone.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Go to RStudio. Click on File > New Project

```{r new project, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/3. New_project.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Select Version Control.

```{r version control, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/4. Version_control.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Select Git.

```{r git, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/5. Git.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Paste the url link from above.

```{r add url, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/6. add_url.png")
```
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

## Branch
You have forked a repository and are ready to start working on the project. Let's talk about branches.

A branch lets you develop code or test an idea without affecting the original project. Once you are happy with the new code, or the idea is tested and working you can merge the branch with master branch. If the idea did not work or you have another idea, the branch can be deleted. None of this will affect the original project.

The master branch is the default branch in Git (also the name).

Let's have a look how to create Git branches, use Git branches and remove Git branches.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

### Make new branch (RStudio)
In RStudio, click on the New Branch button in the Git window. The box next to it will tell you in which branch you are. Master is the default and original branch.

```{r new branch, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/7. NewBranch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Give the branch a short and informative name.
```{r name branch, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/8. NameBranch.png")
```
<br/><br/>
You can now see that you are in the new branch.
```{r new branch 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/9. NewBranch2.png")
```
<br/><br/>

### Write R code (Rstudio)
Now is the time to open a new or an existing file and start to write code. Work in the usual way, do small steps, commit regularly and push (see how to work in with git tutorial). 
```{r make file, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/10. make file.png")
```
<br/><br/>

### Commit and push
!!! This will be a separate tutorial!!! so very briefly described!!!
write code, work in small logical steps (e.g. write a function, fix a function, add a plot, etc.). Do not make too many steps at a time. One step - commit - next step - commit -.... At the end of the day push.
<br/><br/>

### Make pull request (github)
Once you have pushed your branch back to the master branch you can make a pull request. Go back to Github, to the forked repository. A green box appears at the top of the page "pull requst". Click on this button.
<br/><br/>
```{r pull request 1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/12 Pull request.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Add some comments about your pull request if necessary and create the pull request.
<br/><br/>
```{r pull request 2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/13. Pullrequest 2.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Once you have created your pull request, github will check if there are any merge conflict.
<br/><br/>
```{r pull request 3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/14. Pull request 3.png")
```
<br/><br/>
Now it's time for you to relax, have some cake üç∞, you have earned it!
<br/><br/>

### Master accepts pull request (or not)
The owner of the original project has to evaluate your changes to the project. The owner can accept your code, decline or make suggestions for improvement.

You will get a notification if your pull request has been accepted.
<br/><br/>

### Update your fork (Terminal)
Once your pull request has been accepted, you have to update your fork to get the lastest changes. In RStudio open up the terminal:
```{r terminal request, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Pics/11. Terminal.png")
```
<br/><br/>
And type:

Git fetch upstream

Git check out master

Git merge upstream/master


<br/><br/>

### Delete branches
Type:

git branch -d BranchTutorial

This will delete the branch locally.

And

git push origin --delete BranchTutorial

This will delete the branch remotely.
